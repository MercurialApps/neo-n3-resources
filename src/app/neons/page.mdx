# Neo Name Service

The [Neo Name Service (NeoNS)](https://neo.link) is a distributed open naming system based on Neo blockchain.

- [Neo Name Service @ Neo Developers Portal](https://developers.neo.org/docs/n3/Advances/neons/index)

The `.neo` domain from NeoNS does not currently resolve in regular browsers, i.e., if you bought `dapp.neo` and register an 'A' record, users using regular browsers (e.g. Google Chrome) will NOT be able to visit your application by going to `https://dapp.neo`

### Wallets

[NeoLine](/wallets) and [Neon Wallet](/wallets) supports NeoNS names and you can transfer tokens to a NeoNS name, e.g. `alice.neo`.
