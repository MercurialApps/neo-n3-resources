## Burger NEO

[NeoBurger](https://neoburger.io) offers a more "hands off" approach to getting GAS rewards.
You convert your NEO to bNEO and NeoBurger votes on your behalf. You can then redeem GAS with your bNEO.

**Note:** Swapping NEO to bNEO is free. However, there is a [withdraw fee](https://neoburger.github.io) when swapping back from bNEO to NEO.

NeoBurger will [strategize](https://neoburger.github.io/strategy) to maximize GAS rewards by adjusting votes.

Additionally, bNEO is divisible (8 decimals) while NEO is not. You can transfer

## NeoCompounder

[NeoCompounder](https://neocompounder.com) (a recipient of a [GrantShares grant](/grants)) offers another layer of "hands off" GAS rewards.

NeoCompounder introduces the cNEO token which is used to take GAS rewards from voting via bNEO, and compounds it into more bNEO.
