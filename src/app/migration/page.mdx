### FAQ

See https://neo.org/migration#faq

**Q: How long does migration take? When will I receive my tokens on the N3 chain?**

**A:** Migration may take up to 72 hours (3 days). If you still have not received your tokens after 72 hours, you can
join the [Neo discord](https://discord.com/invite/rvZFQ5382k) and ask for help with your migration transaction.
